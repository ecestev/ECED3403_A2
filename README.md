Before a new computer system is brought to market, hardware and software designers often construct emulators to examine how the machine will operate under certain conditions. An emulator “imitates the function of (another system), as by modifications to hardware or software that allow the imitating system to accept the same data, execute the same programs, and achieve the same results as the imitated system”.

In addition to the emulation of the new computer, support software can be required if the computer has an entirely new architecture. This software can include new compilers, assemblers, linkers, and even operating systems.

In the first assignment, a two-pass assembler for the MSP 430 was developed. The second assignment is an extension of the first, requiring the design, implementation, and testing of an emulator for the MSP 430 instruction set architecture (ISA). The emulator is to load and execute S19-files produced by the assembler. A simple debugger is also required.

The emulator and assembler can run on the machine of your choice. They do not have to run on the same machine since the S19-code is transportable.A2
